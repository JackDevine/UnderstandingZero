# Understanding zero
Various experiments in animals have shown that animals are able to understand the fact that a set containing zero objects has less objects than a set containing an integer number of objects:

The above biological research shows that animals have an abstract understanding of the concept of zero. The most simple animal that is known to have the ability to understand zero is a honeybee.

In the notebook LearningZero.ipynb, I show that a simple convolutional neural network is able to understand the abstract concept of zero. This work significntly reduces the complexity of a system that is able to understand zero.
