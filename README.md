# Understanding zero
Experiments have shown that animals are able to understand the fact that a set containing zero objects has less objects than a set containing an integer number of objects:

The most simple animal known to have the ability to understand zero is a honeybee.

See [learning_zero.jl](https://jackdevine.github.io/UnderstandingZero/learning_zero.html) for an example of a nueral network much smaller than a honeybee brain that understands zero.
